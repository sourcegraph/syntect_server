# When keep-alive is on, we observe connection resets in our Go clients of

# not reuse the connection (i.e. we make a fresh connection every time).
# Disabling keep-alive does resolve the issue though, our best guess is that
# this is a bug in Hyper 0.10 (see https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues/928#issuecomment-464632953).
